## Neet Girl Date Night for the PSVITA 

This port was made using the Renpy PSVITA Dist Tool made by SonicMastr so big thanks to him (https://github.com/SonicMastr/renpy-vita). The only thing I really had to do was modify the gui.rpy file and remove a line of code that would crash the game at bootup. This is port Neet Girl Date Night made by Hitsuji Goods. Big thank you to her for allowing me to release this! You can check out her twitter here (https://twitter.com/hitsujigoods). 
Highly suggest you guys support her and check out her amazing art !
The original game can be found here (https://hitsujigoods.itch.io/ngdn).
Big thanks to the entire Neet Girl Date Night team for creating this game. 
Livearea assets were also made by Hitsuji Goods. 


## Notes 

In my testing the game has ran fine for me. The menus can be a little slow but the rest of the game runs entirely fine. The text is off centered and does not stay in the box which is something I will fix later on, but the game is still playable. I'm pretty sure 99.9% of the text in game is readable. If you cant read something you can go to the log in the game.
Launching the game takes a while and on the main menu screen you have to push down on the analog stick and press the X button to get to the actual main menu. 
I would recommend using the touch screen for UI navigation. Saves also work :D
